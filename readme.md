A proof of concept showing how a Stencil web component could be used client-side or server-side rendered from an API endpoint:

- Run `npm start` to view an example client-side usage
- Run `npm api` and visit [http://localhost:3030/](http://localhost:3030/) to view an API endpoint returning the necessary markup for server side rendering.
